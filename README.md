## Project
<br />The data analysis project involves the design of a complete machine learning solution. In particular, the project revolves around the task of identifying the music genre of songs. This is useful as a way to group music into categories that can be later used for recommendation or discovery. The problem of music genre classification is difficult: while some genres distinctions are fairly straightforward (e.g. heavy metal vs classical), others are fuzzier (e.g. rock vs blues).In this data analysis project, your task is to construct a predictor h(x) for each genre Y, which takes the features x and maps it to a probability h(x) that the genre is "rock" (e.g.) or not. You should try out different machine learning methods, including but not limited to those presented throughout this course, for predicting the music genre of songs. The dataset which is provided to solve this task contains preprocessed audio information. In particular, the raw audio signals have been transformed to carefully chosen features.
## The data
<br />●train_data.csv -the training data set, providing 4363 samples described by 264 features.
<br />●train_labels.csv-the labels of the train samples.
<br />●test_data.csv-the 6544 test samples of which the labels should be predicted. Don't change the order of the samples, as your predicted labels should be ordered accordingly.
<br />●dummy_example_solution.csv-a sample submission file in the correct format, used as a benchmark solution.
